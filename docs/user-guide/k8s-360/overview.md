#### Investigate through quick view 

##### See Metrics

Whether you’re viewing a deployment, node, or pod, you can easily investigate the different issues you might encounter. 

Each quick view menu contains the **View Metrics** button, allowing you to view the relevant information in a Grafana application. This can provide a focused overview of the chosen element, allowing you to pinpoint what happened and when it started quickly.

##### See Logs

Node and pod views include the **See Logs** button, which opens an OpenSearch Dashboard screen with the relevant query to display the log information.

If you’ve manually set up your Kubernetes account, you might get an empty query with no results. In this case, you can view all related logs using a custom filter.

Click on **Add filter** at the top of the screen. The fields vary according to your chosen view; add `kubernetes.host` to the field to view Node related logs. To view Pod related logs, add `kubernetes.pod_name` to the field.

Next, choose the operator. For example, you can select **exists** to view all related logs.

##### Open Livetail

Node and pod views include the **Open Livetail** button, which opens Logz.io's Livetail filtered with the selected Kubernetes host. Live tail gives you a live view of your logs as they come into Logz.io, allowing you to view and troubleshoot in real time.


##### Locate

To re-focus your view, click the **Locate** button at the top of the quick view menu. This will scroll back to the specific deployment, node, or pod you're investigating.

![Locate button](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/locate-button.gif)

<!-- ##### Logs tab

Nodes and pods quick view menu has an additional **Logs** tab containing a table with all the logs related to the chosen node or pod. The table includes the total number of logs, the time they were ingested, the log level, and its message.

![Logs inside nodes](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/logs-inside-nodes.png)

You can sort the table by clicking on each header: **Time**, **Log level**, or **Message**. Click on the same header again to change your view to ascending/descending. -->

#### Calculating Log error rate

To calculate percentage error, we take the percentage of errors in the last 15 minutes and the percentage of errors in the last 2 hours:

`Errors in the last 15 minutes <= Amount of errors in the last 2 hours`

For example, if in the last 15 minutes there were 10 log errors out of 200 total logs, it means that there's a total of 5% errors:

`10/200 * 100 = 5%`

And if in the last 2 hours there were 15 log errors out of 800 total logs, the percentage of errors will be 1.8%:

`15/800 * 100 = 1.8%`

So the log error rate you'll see will be 177.7%, based on the following formula:

`(5/1.8 * 100) - 100 = 177.7%`

Additional examples: 

* Last 15 minutes = 5 error logs out of 50 total logs = 5/50 * 100 = 10%
* Last 2 hours = 6 error logs out of 800 total logs = 6/800 * 100 = 0.75%
* Error rate = (10/0.75 * 100) - 100 = 1233.3%

Or:

* Last 15 minutes = 2 error logs out of 100 total logs = 2/100 * 100 = 2%
* Last 2 hours = 2 error logs out of 800 total logs = 2/800 * 100 = 0.25%
* Error rate = (2/0.25 * 100) - 100 = 700%
